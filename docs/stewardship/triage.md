# Triage

How proposed work gets evaluated against the stewardship docs.

Sources of proposed work are many: design proposals, refactor
ideas, library upgrades, feature requests, breaking-change calls,
"while I was in there" cleanups, cross-SDK divergence flags,
observations from review passes. The flow below applies regardless
of source. The underlying docs (`posture.md`,
`goals-and-non-goals.md`, `trust-model.md`, `resilience.md`,
`performance-bar.md`, `test-discipline.md`, `simplicity.md`,
`elm-invariants.md`, `dsl-discipline.md`, `concurrency-shape.md`)
are the authority on each axis; this file is a consolidated
routing tool.

## Outcomes

For any proposed work, one of:

- **Do.** Aligned with a stated goal, addresses a real bug, or
  is plain maintenance hygiene that does not warrant a
  stewardship-level question.
- **Defer to a roadmap item.** Real concern tied to a
  considered direction not currently scheduled. Append to the
  relevant `roadmap/<item>.md` "Observations" section as
  context for when the work is taken up.
- **Decline.** Misframed against the trust model, defends
  against speculative futures or impossible states, asks for
  work without the evidence the relevant doc requires, or
  otherwise lands on a stated non-goal.
- **Route to cross-SDK parity.** Concerns parity drift or an
  SDK API shape that affects parity. Goes through the
  `plushie-sdk-parity` workflow rather than being decided
  here.

## Routing flow

For a piece of proposed work, run these in order. First match
wins.

1. **Cross-SDK shape.** Does the work alter or surface drift
   in an API shape, behavior name, parameter ordering, event
   field shape, or wire form across multiple SDKs? Route to
   the parity workflow. plushie-elixir is the shape
   tiebreaker; see `posture.md`.

2. **Elm invariants.** Does the work touch the
   `init`/`update`/`view` contract, the return-shape
   validation, command shape, subscription diffing, widget
   event flow, the None-return detection, or scoped IDs?
   Treat as a deliberate decision; default to no unless the
   change is genuinely a fix to the contract. The contract
   is the cross-SDK story; see `elm-invariants.md`.

3. **Trust-model misframe.** Does the proposal assume a
   threat model the project does not currently make a claim
   against (host as adversary under an unclaimed boundary,
   browser-grade isolation of arbitrary remote hosts, wire-
   as-its-own-crypto)? Decline; reference `trust-model.md`.

4. **Renderer-to-host integrity.** Does the work touch the
   decoder in a way that loosens the closed-shape contract
   (unstructured passthrough of unknown event shapes,
   opaque-blob delivery to user code, spoofable response
   correlation, attribute lookup based on renderer-supplied
   names)? Treat as a deliberate decision, not a routine
   refactor; default to no.

5. **Resilience axis.** Does the work address a real
   things-go-wrong path that fails ungracefully (an
   unhandled exception in the runtime loop, a missed revert
   on view error, a stale effect tag, a thread that hangs
   instead of exits, a reconnect that races with shutdown)?
   Do; reference `resilience.md`. Conversely, does the
   proposal add defensive layers for conditions that cannot
   occur given the surrounding invariants? Decline.

6. **Wire codec correctness.** Encode/decode symmetry,
   round-trip through MessagePack and JSONL, field-name
   drift between encoder and renderer. Do; stated goal.

7. **Lightweight by default.** Does the work consolidate
   redundant work, choose a data structure better suited to
   the realistic profile, remove clearly unnecessary
   per-call cost (an extra comprehension, redundant key
   stringification, repeated `dict.get` chains where a
   destructure would do), while preserving or improving
   readability? Do; reference `performance-bar.md`.
   Conversely, is the work clever-for-speed at the cost of
   intent, or a big-O claim without realistic N? Decline
   absent measurement.

8. **Test discipline.** Does the work move tests off the
   integration spine (mocking the renderer, replacing real
   binary tests with pure-Python stubs, peeking at private
   runtime state from a test)? Decline; reference
   `test-discipline.md`. Does it move tests onto the spine
   (rewriting a stub test to run through the binary)? Do.

9. **DSL extension.** Does the proposal add a new builder
   pattern, a new event dataclass, a new command factory,
   a new ABC, a new decorator, or a new value type? Run
   the criteria in `dsl-discipline.md` (cross-SDK shape
   answered first, two real users, real bug class,
   resulting code reads cleanly, type checker stays
   precise, error messages point at the call site). If it
   does not pass, decline or defer.

10. **Concurrency shape change.** Does the work introduce a
    new long-lived thread, change which thread owns model
    state, alter the Connection/Runtime split, add asyncio
    to the runtime path, add `multiprocessing`, or change
    shutdown posture? Treat as a stewardship-level
    question; reference `concurrency-shape.md`.

11. **Simplicity axis.** Single-user abstraction extracted
    as an ABC or Protocol? Module split without a forcing
    function? Premature generic where specific would do?
    `# type: ignore` to silence pyright on a real
    mismatch? Decline; reference `simplicity.md`.
    Conversely, three-similar-lines that have grown into
    a real concept and want to be abstracted? Do.

12. **Stated non-goal.** Backwards compatibility before 1.0,
    API stability hardening as standalone work, coverage
    milestones, refactoring without a forcing function,
    asyncio in user code, defending against a speculative
    deployment shape. Decline; reference
    `goals-and-non-goals.md`.

## Default behavior

If nothing matches and the work is plain maintenance
(advisories, portability bugs, broken examples, dead code,
typo-class corrections, obvious self-consistency
restorations), the default is to do it without a stewardship
category. The flow earns its keep on the harder cases:
declining speculative defenses, deferring to roadmap items,
recognizing trust-model misframes, distinguishing real
algorithmic consolidation from speculative micro-optimization,
distinguishing real DSL extensions from costume abstractions,
recognizing concurrency-shape changes as stewardship-level.

## When the docs need updating

If the proposed work feels stewardship-level (a real direction
question, a new constraint, a posture the docs have not yet
taken) but does not match any axis above, that is a signal the
docs are missing a category. Surface the question to the
maintainer rather than improvising a category, and update the
docs once the direction is settled.

The docs decay when every novel question gets shoehorned into
the closest existing axis. They stay useful by being explicit
about what they cover and acknowledging when they do not cover
something.
